sphinx: a password **S**tore that **P**erfectly **H**ides from **I**tself
(**N**o **X**aggeration)

pwdsphinx is python wrapper around libsphinx - a cryptographic password storage
as described in https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/1099

## Dependencies

You need [libsphinx](https://github.com/stef/libsphinx).

You need also to install `pysodium` using either your OS package
manager or pip.

If you want to use also the websphinx browser extension you need to
install also an X11 variant of pinentry from the gnupg project:

 - either `apt-get install pinentry-qt`
 - or `apt-get install pinentry-gtk2`
 - or `apt-get install pinentry-gnome3`
 - or `apt-get install pinentry-fltk`

(or anything equivalent to `apt-get install` on your OS)

## Installation

`pip3 install pwdsphinx` should get you started.

## API

`sphinxlib` is a `ctypes`-based python wrapper around [libsphinx](https://github.com/stef/libsphinx), so
you can build whatever you fancy immediately in python. The interface
exposed wraps the 3 sphinx functions from the library like this:

```
def challenge(pwd)
```

returns bfac and chal

```
def respond(chal, secret)
```
return the response

```
def finish(pwd, bfac, resp)
```

returns the raw 32 byte password.

## Server/Client

Since the sphinx protocol only makes sense if the "device" is
somewhere else than where you type your password, pwdsphinx
comes with a server implemented in py3 which you can host off-site
from your usual desktop/smartphone. Also a client is supplied which is
able to communicate with the server and manage passwords.

Both the client and the server can be configured by any of the
following files:
 - `/etc/sphinx/config`
 - `~/.sphinxrc`
 - `~/.config/sphinx/config`
 - `./sphinx.cfg`

Files are parsed in this order, this means global settings can be
overridden by per-user and per-directory settings.

### oracle - the server

pwdsphinx comes with a python reference implementation of a extended sphinx
server called oracle.

The server can be "configured" by changing the variables in the
`[server]` section of the config file.

The `address` is the IP address on which the server is listening,
default is `localhost` - you might want to change that.

The `port` where the server is listening is by default 2355.

`datadir` specifies the data directory where all the device "secrets"
are stored, this defaults to "data/" in the current directory. You
might want to back up this directory from time to time to an encrypted
medium.

`verbose` enables logging to standard output.

Change these settings to fit your needs. Starting the server
can be done simply by:

```
./oracle.py
```

### sphinx - the client

This is the client that connects to the oracle to manage passwords
using the extended sphinx protocol.

#### Client Configuration

Like the server, the client can be configured changing the settings in
the `[client]` section of the config file. The `host` and `port` should
match what you set in the server.

The datadir (default: `~/.sphinx`) variable holds the location for your client
parameters. Particularly it contains a masterkey which is used to derive
secrets. The master key - if not available - is generated by issuing an init
command. You might want to back up and encrypt the master key.

#### Operations

The client provides the following operations: Create, Get, Change, Commit,
Undo, List, Delete, Read, Write. All operations need a username and a site this
password belongs to, even if they're only empty strings.

#### Create password

Creating a new password for a site is easy, pass your "master"
password on standard input to the client, and provide parameters like
in this example:

```sh
echo 'my master password' | ./sphinx.py create username https://example.com ulsd 0
```

The parameters to the client are `create` for the operation, then `username`
for the username on the site `https://example.com` then a combination of the
letters `ulsd` and the `0` for the size of the final password. The letters
`ulsd` stand in order for the following character classes: `u` upper-case
letters, `l` lower-case letters, `s` symbols and `d` for digits. If the command
runs successfully - the resulting new high-entropy password according to the
given rules is printed to the console.

Note1, since the master password is not used to encrypt anything, you can
actually use different "master" passwords for different user/site combinations.  

Note2, using echo is only for demonstration, you should use something like this
instead:
```sh
echo GETPIN | pinentry | grep '^D' | cut -c3- | ./sphinx.py create username https://example.com ulsd 0
```
Using pinentry you can go fancy and do double password input, and even have
something checking password quality for you, check it out, it's quite
versatile.

#### Get password

Getting a password from the sphinx oracle works by running the
following command:

```sh
echo 'my master password' | ./sphinx.py get username https://example.com
```

Here again you supply your master password on standard input, provide
the `get` operation as the first parameter, your `username` as the 2nd
and the `site` as the 3rd parameter. The resulting password is
returned on standard output.

#### Change password

You might want to (be forced to regularly) change your password, this
is easy while you can keep your master password the unchanged (or you
can change it too, if you want). The command is this:

```sh
echo 'my master password' | ./sphinx.py change username https://example.com
```

Here again you supply your master password on standard input. This
master password can be the same, but can also be a new password if you
want to change also the master password. You provide the `change`
operation as the first parameter to the client, your `username` as the
2nd and the `site` as the 3rd parameter. Your new new password is
returned on standard output.

#### Committing a changed password

After changing the password, you will still get the old password when running
`get`. To switch to use the new password you have to commit the changes with

```sh
echo 'my master password' | ./sphinx.py commit username https://example.com
```

#### Undoing a password commit
If you somehow messed up and have to go back to use the old password, you can
undo committing your password using:

```sh
echo 'my master password' | ./sphinx.py commit username https://example.com
```

#### Deleting passwords

In case you want to delete a password, you can do using the following
command:

```
./sphinx.py delete username https://example.com
```

You provide the `delete` operation as the first parameter to the
client, your `username` as the 2nd and the `site` as the 3rd
parameter. This command does not need anything on standard input, nor
does it provide anything on standard output in case everything goes
well.

#### Storing short blobs

Many password managers provide a means to store arbitrary user chosen weak
passwords. This is a bad practice, but expected by users, the extended sphinx
protocol does support this, but advises against its usage. If you want to
disobey the advice, you can store blobs of not more than 8190 bytes like this:

```sh
echo -ne 'asdf\nfoobarbazqwerasdf' | ./sphinx.py write username https://example.com
```

This would store the "incredibly strong" `foobarbazqwerasdf` string as a blob
encrypted by the even less impressive password `asdf`.

Which you can query later using:

```sh
echo -n 'asdf' | ./sphinx.py read username https://example.com
```

But really, don't do this. It is really bad practice. Instead use the sphinx
client to store a normal strong sphinx password (which you create using
`create`) and use that password for encrypting a file using anything that
encrypts like age, pbp.
