pwdsphinx for Debian

pwdsphinx is a python wrapper around libsphinx.

   The SPHINX protocol is cryptographic password storage with much stronger
   security guarantees than your average password manager.

   pwdsphinx also comes with a reference server implementation, a command-line
   client, and a few helper-scripts to integrate the client into X11.
